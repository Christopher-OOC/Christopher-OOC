- 👋 Hi, I’m Christopher
- 👀 I’m a web developer with 4 years experience on java platform.
- I am a pragmatic programmer who has the following skills: Java, Spring, Hibernate, Relational Databases, Restful Web Services, Microservices, Apache Kafka, Elastic Search, OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flows, Maven, Git, AWS, Unit Testing and Integration Testing and Front End with React.js and Bootstrap 5. After Java, my next favourite language is Dart with flutter being my best framework for mobile applications. In near future, I will start my Apache Spark adventure for big data. If I am not coding, then I will be reading history or geo-political books.
